OpenShift Staging
=================

The application will push to openshift correctly, but manual steps are needed to get it to run.

The openshift repository settings can be found by logging in to openshift - for details, see the passwords database.

To avoid any problems with eclipse pushing to multiple remote locations, it is recommended that this is run from a command line.

>git push openshift master

This will take a long time to complete, with messages from the remote end as activator performs its resource resooving
and compilation steps.  This normally seems to fail after the packaging of the javadoc jar file is complete - in that case,
open an ssh connection to the openshift server (ssh 5465d6974382ec4ebe0001c5@jncc-trondev1.rhcloud.com)

cd play2/bin
./control build
./control start

This should complete fairly quickly, and at this point the application will be available at:
