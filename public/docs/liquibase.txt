Liquibase

Liquibase can be downloaded from http://www.liquibase.org/download/index.html.

Once downloaded and installed the Liquibase update can be run and rerun at any time.  Liquibase 
records which changes have been executed on the database and so updates will always only be applied if
they haven't already been applied to this database and will be applied in the correct order.
 
Before running ensure that you know the following:
1) Where is the postgresql-9.3-1102.jdbc3.jar file on your system?
2) Where is the changelog.xml file which is part of the application distribution?
3) Where is the PostgreSQL server?
4) What is the name of the database?
5) What is the database username?
6) What is the database user's password?
7) What is the schema name? 
 
The command should be run on one line (not on separate lines as displayed below).

liquibase.bat --driver=org.postgresql.Driver --classpath=/path/to/postgresql-9.3-1102.jdbc3.jar 
--changeLogFile=/path/to/schema_changes/changelog.xml --url="jdbc:postgresql://server:5432/database" 
--username=xxxx --password=xxxx --defaultSchemaName=jncc update

The command should return with SUCCESS.
