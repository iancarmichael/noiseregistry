Development Environment Setup

1. Ensure that a Java 1.7 JDK is available (as 32 bit or 64 bit depending on which eclipse platform will be used) - verify by opening a command prompt and running: "javac -version" or "java -version" - the response should be something like: "javac 1.7.0_71".
2. Install the latest version of eclipse (Luna, v4.4 - should be available on the filesystem?)
3. Open eclipse and import the Git repository as a new project by following these steps:
	3.1 File - Import - Git\Projects from GIT
	3.2 Select the "Clone URI" option and click "Next"
	3.3 Enter the Location URI as "https://github.com/JNCC-dev-team/noiseregistry.git" (Host and Repository Path should then be populated)
	3.4 Add the user name and password (as used to sign in to GitHub) and click "Next"
	3.5 In the branch selection, make sure that "master" has been selected and click "Next"
	3.6 Enter the local directory to use e.g. C:\Data\eclipse4.4\workspace\noiseregistry and click "Next"
	3.7 Select "Import as general project" and click "Next"
	3.8 The project name should have defaulted to the directory name used in 3.6, so click "Finish"

NOTE: always do a Pull before a Push, to make sure that any changes to the same branch have been merged into 
	  your local repository before Pushing to the remote repository.  If this is not done, it will appear in the 
	  workspace as though all your changes have been committed correctly, but there will be local changes that have 
	  not been synchronised with the remote repository. 

Application Launch

To start the application open a command prompt, change to the directory entered in 3.6 then run: 
	activator -Dconfig.file=conf/dev.conf ~run

This will take a bit of time on the first run as it downloads all the dependencies, but when it completes you should be able to browse to 
	http://localhost:9000
