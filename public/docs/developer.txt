Development Environment Setup

1. Ensure that a Java 1.7 JDK is available (as 32 bit or 64 bit depending on your version of Windows) 
	- Download the Java SE Development Kit 7 ( jdk-7u71-windows-1586.exe or jdk-7u71-windows-x64.exe)
	- Follow the installation instructions at https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/webnotes/install/windows/jdk-installation-windows.html
	- Add C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0_71\bin to your PATH system variable in environment variables
	- Verify the path is set correctly by opening a command prompt and running: "javac -version" - the response should be something like: "javac 1.7.0_71".
2. Install the latest version of eclipse (Luna, v4.4)
	- Download the "Eclipse IDE for Java Developers" (eclipse-java-luna-SR1-win32-x86_64.zip)
	- Extract the zip file to the required file location (e.g., C:\Prog\eclipse44)
3. Open eclipse and import the git repository as a new project by following these steps:
	- File - Import - Git\Projects from GIT
	- Select the "Clone URI" option and click "Next"
	- Enter the Location URI as "https://github.com/JNCC-dev-team/noiseregistry.git" (Host and Repository Path should then be populated)
	- Add the user name and password (as used to sign in to GitHub) and click "Next"
	- In the branch selection, make sure that "master" has been selected and click "Next"
	- Enter the local directory to use e.g. C:\Data\eclipse4.4\workspace\noiseregistry and click "Next"
	- Select "Import as general project" and click "Next"
	- The project name should have defaulted to the directory name used in 3.6, so click "Finish"

JNCC Noise Registry Application Launch
To start the application open a command prompt, change to the directory entered in 3.6 then run:
	activator eclipse (one time only during configuration)
	activator -Dconfig.file=conf/dev.conf ~run (needed every time application to be launched)

This will take a bit of time on the first run as it downloads all the dependencies, but when it completes you should be able to browse to 
	http://localhost:9000
	
Optional: 
Scala provides editors that "understand" the content for application routes, scala template files etc. To install this:
	- From "Help, Install New Software..." menu item in eclipse, add a new site, title "Scala", uri: http://download.scala-ide.org/sdk/lithium/e44/scala211/dev/site
	- When you get the list of available items, select the all the entries except for the "Scala IDE for Eclipse Development Support"
After eclipse restarts, you should find that the routes file in conf has a custom editor, as do the *.scala.html template files in the app\views folder.
