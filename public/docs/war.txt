WAR File Generation

The Play Framework application does not need any servlet container to run the application.  However,
in order to generate a WAR file and deply this to Tomcat 7 follow the steps below.  This assumes that 
a Tomcat 7 server is already installed (http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/setup.html) and
that a PostgreSQL database is also installed and 
configured (https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Detailed_installation_guides).

From the root of the project (containing the activator file) in a command prompt run:
activator war

This generates the .war file in the target directory.  The .war file contains a servlet class 
which causes Tomcat to fail to load the application.  This needs to be removed prior to 
deploying the .war file.  Open the file (unzip) and delete the 
WEB-INF\lib\org.apache.tomcat.tomcat-servlet-api-8.0.5.jar file.
The .war file can then be deployed to the Tomcat 7 server using the Tomcat manager interface. 

NOTE: Since setting the build to servlet 2.5 the deletion of the jar file above does not seem to be necessary,
but it hasn't be used extensively at this point.
