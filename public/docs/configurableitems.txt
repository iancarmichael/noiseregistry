There are a number of items that can be configured through text files in the system.

The system will need to be redeployed after changes.

Messages
The messages files contains almost all strings output by the application.  Hence labels, field help,
error messages etc. can all be configured by changing the text in this file.

In addition, the file contains the code for Google Analytics.  The file also contains the static text for 
the initial welcome, feedback, help, cookies, contact and terms and conditions pages.  The format of the 
text requires multi-line entries to be terminated with a back slash (\).


Emails
All of the email templates are in the views.email directory.  The names of these should be self-explanatory.
